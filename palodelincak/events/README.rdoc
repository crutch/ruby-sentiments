ruby-sentiments - events
========================

User interface
--------------
I focused on simple user interface which will be similiar to real life event choosing. I wanted to create feeling that user is selecting between event brouchures (or some kind of presentation). 

Technology
----------
I used Ruby on Rails because of future growing potential of this application and because of my previous experience also. Additional technologies are Twitter Bootstrap (for easier future work with user interface), Slim lang (for lighter and faster views), CoffeeScript (for handling events).

Usage
-----

* ``bundle``
* ``rake db:migrate``
* ``rake db:seed``
* ``rails s``
