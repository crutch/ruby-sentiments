h1. Ruby sentiments

During our endless development discussions, we always wonder how THIS guy would solve SOMETHING we are currently working on. Although programming is an exact discipline, code solving a THING differs person to person. And it would be really nice to be able to compare different approaches to everyday problems. Here you go:

h2. Rules
# Some (means 3-5) rubyists concurrently work on 1 specification from the area of web development. They don't spend on this more than 1 evening (equal to about 2-4 hours max).
# Rubyists push their work to this repo and comment their work (shortly, but well) in the Readme.
# At a regular Ruby meeting, rubyists present their code in person in front of other devs. Important thing that should be heard from them is WHY such a code was written, not just HOW it works.

Of course this shouldn't be a one off event. While every solution is interesting to see, the real fun comes, when the original task has to be extended or even changed a lot. That way we could compare the amount (and complexity) of changes needed to satisfy this new specification.

h3. Specification 1:
# User can see list of events (name, description, date, from time, to time).
# User can sign to attend any of those events. 
# User can visit this page later and still see his attendance.

In this repo, you can see results of that. One directory per developer, Readme's explaining developers decisions.
