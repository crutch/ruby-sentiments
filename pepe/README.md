# Simple registration for meetups

## Present

Really basic static site generated by the [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).

It uses template with slim, sass (Bourbon + Neat + Bitters) and cofeescript.

## Future

Add service api layers, which will store registrations on the backend.

## Usage

Clone the repo, ``cd`` in ``bundle install``. Then just run ``middleman`` for
development server or ``middleman build`` for building static site.
